# Hands-on tutorial on using Islandora Workbench to update content in your repository

## Overview and goals

During this 1.5 hour session, you will gain experience using Islandora Workbench to update your repository's content. After spending some time preparing your CSV and media files, you will move on to running Workbench to apply those changes to existing nodes and media.

## Prerequisites

- some experience using Islandora Workbench (doesn't matter what type of tasks) - important thing is that you know what configuration files are, what `--check` does, and that you're comfortable with the command line
- a working instance of Islandora Workbench on your computer (the more recent the better)

Sample data, and instances of Islandora, will be provided.

## Setup

Before we start practicing updates to content, we need to create some nodes and media we will later update.

## Exercises

### Updating node fields
